<h3>Teaching Philosophy</h3>
My classes are usually made up of a mix of students; undergraduates, master students and PhD students and all from different fields of study. I enjoy this kind of dynamic classroom. <br>
        I tend to mix black-board lectures with computer demonstrations for all my classes. My goal in teaching is that the students leave my class recognizing that statistical modeling is not a "push-the-button" type exercise, and every data set requires unique consideration. <br> <br> <br> <br>

			<h3>Courses & Workshops </h3>

		<p> In past years I have cycled teaching applied statistics couses (Linear models, Applied multivariate analysis) and method courses (Statistical inference principles and Survival analysis). <br>
My main focus for teaching now is <a href="http://www.math.chalmers.se/Stat/Grundutb/GU/MSA220/S19/"><b>Statistical Learning for Big Data </b> </a> and master thesis projects. <br>

<!--I also teach PhD courses, sometimes jointly with upper division masters programs (Sparse modeling, Empirical Bayes, Bootstrap methods). -->

Here are some links to recent courses:
