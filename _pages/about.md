My research centers on the development of new statistical methodology for neural networks, network modeling, clustering and model selection, with applications to high-dimensional biological data.

My group consists of students and postdocs, and master students that work on in-house project or industry projects. In-house projects range from multi-group and multi-view data integration, multilayer network modeling, interpretable deep neural networks and analysis challenges in systems biology. For more details, please check the  **List of Current Projects** below - we are always looking for master students who want to get involved in research projects.

Research profile
------
Data integration and joint modeling are a rich source for research problems. These types of problems are central components in several joint projects in collaboration with [ Sven Nelander's group](http://nelanderlab.org).
Our group aims to formulate integrated models for mRNA, microRNA, DNA copy number, methylation and mutation in human cancer. These projects are supported
by two grants from the [Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research](href="https://strategiska.se/en/") as well as the [Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software
Program (WASP)](https://wasp-sweden.org/) and the [SciLifeLab and Wallenberg National Program for Data-Driven Life Science (DDLS)](https://www.scilifelab.se/data-driven).
We also collaborate with [Mika Gustafsson's group](https://liu.se/en/employee/mikgu75) at
Linköping University on data integration tasks, with a special emphasis on the utilization of prior biological information. This project is also funded through WASP and DDLS.

In a joint research project with [Professor Giuseppe Durisi](https://gdurisi.github.io/), Chalmers Electrical Engineering, we investigate the generalization properties of deep neural networks -
how come such over-parameterized models perform so well on test data?
The project "Generalization bounds for Deep Neural Networks: Insight and Design" is funded through the [Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software
Program (WASP)](https://wasp-sweden.org/).


Together with [Balazs Kulcsar](https://www.chalmers.se/sv/personal/Sidor/balazs-adam-kulcsar.aspx) at
Electrical Engineering, we work on research problems merging control theory and neural networks. This work is funded by [Centiro Solutions](https://www.centiro.se/).

Academic Service
------

Since 2018, I am the [Vice-Dean for Research and Research Infrastructures](https://science.gu.se/english/about/organisation/steering_group/?languageId=100001&disableRedirect=true&returnUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fscience.gu.se%2Ffakulteten%2FOrganisation%2Fledningsgruppen%2F) at the [Faculty of Science](https://science.gu.se/), University of Gothenburg.
I chair the Faculty Board's [advisory committee](https://medarbetarportalen.gu.se/internt-science/organisation-styrning/styrelse-och-beredningsgrupper/forskningsberedningen/?languageId=100001&skipSSOCheck=true&referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F) advisory committee, where we discuss interdepartmental activities, review sabbatical applications and
Faculty prizes and awards. We also organize faculty events. 



Current projects
======

We are always looking for master students who want to be a part of our research team. Please contact me if any of the projects sound interesting to you.
You are also welcome to contact me with your own project idea. I usually supervise 5-7 master students each year.

- ***Neural Networks and Control Theory.*** Together with my student [Vincent Szolnoky](https://se.linkedin.com/in/vincent-szolnoky-49055919a) and [Professor Balazs Kulcsar](https://www.chalmers.se/sv/personal/Sidor/balazs-adam-kulcsar.aspx) at Electrical Engineering, I work on problems ranging from methodological and theoretical challenges in neural networks to practical applications in logistics and transportation.
- We are currently investigating ***Spatial cluster regularized* regression models** in the context of spatial transcriptomics data. The idea is to find the key regulators that are associated with cell-states in different regions of the brain. This is joint work with [Mika Gustafsson's group](https://liu.se/en/employee/mikgu75") at Linköping University and [Sven Nelander's group](http://nelanderlab.org) at Uppsala University 
- ***AI-Integromics.*** We have several theses projects centering on the development of data integration methods for systems biology using deep neural networks paired with structured regularization. This is joint work with [Mika Gustafsson's group](https://liu.se/en/employee/mikgu75") at Linköping University and [Sven Nelander's group](http://nelanderlab.org) at Uppsala University.
- In our recent paper, [***Reconstructing the regulatory programs*** underlying the phenotypic plasticity of neural cancers(https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-53954-3), we use an iterative clustering and model selection procedure to identify *regulatory programs* in glioblastoma. A current master thesis project focuses on generalizing this to other data distributions.
- ***Digital twins for drug combination identification.*** We are exploring how to use GBM growth models to generate synthetic data for accelerated drug-combination discovery. This project is related to the newly formed [CNSx3 center](https://strategiska.se/en/press-release/copy-of-the-brain-gets-sek-60-million/). This 60MSEK center *CNSx3: Transformative Models for Brain Diseases* will build brain organoid models to develop personalized treatment regimens.
